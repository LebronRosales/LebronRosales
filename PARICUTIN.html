<p>Even avid travelers may not know about Paricutin, mainly because this natural wonder resides in Michoac√°n, Mexico. This cinder cone volcano was named one of the 7 natural wonders of the world, even over famous volcanoes, such as Yellowstone.

Paricutin last erupted in 1952. It was coined one of the natural wonders of the world because mankind witnessed its birth and rapidly growing formation. You can venture on a twelve-mile round-trip to the peak of the volcano, either by hiking or horseback. Hikers will walk through sandy banks and lava fields surrounding the volcano.

You can explore Paricutin at any time of the year. It's located about a seven-hour drive from Mexico City. Combine a trip to the volcano with a visit to the capital city for a bit of nature and culture all in one. Accommodation near the volcano can be found in the city of Urapan.</p>
