<p>The Northern Lights have become a sensation for tourists traveling in the Northern Hemisphere. The Northern Lights are auroras, or naturally occurring phenomena that consist of mystifying displays of light in the sky. The northern lights dance across the sky and emanate a diffused glow along the northern horizon.

The intensity of northern lights increases as you head north towards the magnetic pole in the Arctic. Unfortunately, the northern lights appear only randomly, making it a challenge for travelers to see while on a short trip. They are more often experienced by locals who live in these northern regions.

Planning a trip to the see the northern lights presents a variety of options for interesting destinations around the world. The best places to see the northern lights are in the far part of the Northern Hemisphere, including Canada's far north, Alaska, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and Finland.

The probability of seeing Northern Lights increases during the winter months. They occur throughout the year but the dark skies in winter make them easier to see.</p>
