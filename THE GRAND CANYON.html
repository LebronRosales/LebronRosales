<p>You only need to stand on the rim of the Grand Canyon once to know why it's one of the 7 natural wonders of the natural world. The Grand Canyon's massive and colorful landscape provides breathtaking views that can't be found anywhere else in the world.

Most visitors head to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon and spend a full day admiring the views from the overlooks that stretch along the top of the canyon. If you are in good shape and want to have a more immersive experience, head down into the canyon on one of the numerous hiking trails. For something a little less strenuous, take a helicopter tour of the Grand Canyon for an unforgettable lifetime experience.

If you are interested in the formation and geology of the canyon, stop in at the Geological Museum to learn about what you are seeing. From Lipan Point along Desert View Drive, you can get a great view of the rock layers in the canyon wall.

The Grand Canyon is located in Arizona, USA. The closest major cities are Las Vegas and Phoenix.</p>
