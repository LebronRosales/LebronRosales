<p>Victoria Falls is located in Africa along the borders of Zambia and Zimbabwe. This spectacular waterfall runs off from the Zambezi River.

Visitors can access the falls from Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe and Livingston in Zambia. Cross the border to gain different perspectives of this magnificent natural wonder. The best views are from Zimbabwe, but you can get a closer experience from Zambia. Helicopter tours and microlight tours are another great way to see the falls. If you are brave, consider a swim in the Devil's Pool, located pretty much at the edge of the falls on the Zambia side

The rainy season runs from late November through early April. A good time to visit is immediately after this, when the volume of water coming over the falls is still immense, but the weather is pleasant.

Getting to Victoria Falls is easy whether you choose to fly into Zambia or Zimbabwe. The airport in Zambia, Harry Mwanga Nkumbula International Airport (LVI), is closer and the more popular of the two. Most people fly into Johannesburg and then fly out from there to the falls. Be sure to keep an eye on your baggage weight, as the smaller planes flying into these airports have lower limits.</p>
